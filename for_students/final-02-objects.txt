7. Helicopter-1* - a helicopter made of basic geometry from WB7

(Optional) Backup Objects (more objects that you created, in case the ones above don't count):
- Townhouse-1 - a textured house made of buffer geometry from WB8
- CementMixer-1* - a cement mixer made of basic geometry from WB7
- Tree-1* - a pine tree made from basic geometry from WB8

At least on of each type of object:
Building/structure: ModernHouse-1* - (described above)
Vehicle: Car-1* - (described above)
