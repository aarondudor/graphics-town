My town's theme is a modern suburban town that is going through a reconstruction period. The town is a fairly normal town with regular sized houses, a park and a cemetary. There is also some new construction happening on one of the blocks, and there is a newly built satellite radar that is in a forest next to the graveyard. A news helicopter is also circling the area documenting the reconstuction that is going on in the town.
